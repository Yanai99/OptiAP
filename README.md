## Project Documentation

Our project aims to improve the deployment of wireless access points (APs) in small to medium-sized environments. By combining software algorithms and hardware implementation using ESP32 microcontrollers, we provide a cost-effective and user-friendly solution for optimal AP placement. Users can upload area maps, conduct surveys, and receive recommendations for the number and placement of APs. This approach aims to simplify wireless network optimization, empowering individuals and small organizations to enhance their network coverage without extensive resources or expertise
